          Cybersecurity is the domain of protecting computers, systems, and technology from external and internal threats.  This is done by the use of Operating System, networking, and application security inplementations and technologies.

          <h3>
          Timeline history of cybersecurity:  
          </h3>
          <p>
            <span>1971</span>- The first computer virus called "Creeper" was created in a lab and it was able to move itself from one computer to another.  
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>1982</span>- The first pc virus to attack PCs in the general population was called "Elk Cloner".
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>1986</span>-  A cybersecurity bill was passed by the U.S. government called "Computer Fraud and Abuse Act".  The act was made to implement laws against illegal computer activity before which there were not any laws specifically designed for illegal usage of computers.    
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>1987</span>-  McAfee created and launched the first anti-virus product named "VirusScan".  
          </p>
          <span>1988</span>:  
          <ul>
            <li>The first computer worm, called the "Morris Worm" was launched by a student on MIT's network and infected computers.  This act by the student would lead to the first felony conviction under the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.  </li>
            <li>The US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency created a federally funded non-profit research and development center called "Cert Coordination Center".  This organization does research to find software bugs and viruses that can affect computers and networks, so that solutions can be found against them and make the internet safer.   </li>
            <li>The first network firewall was created by Digital Equipment Corporation.  </li>
          </ul>
          <span>1989</span>:  
          <ul>
            <li>The first ransomeware attack occured, it was named "PC Cyborg Virus", and it was propogated via Floppy Disks sent via mail.  </li>
            <li>The first network Intrusion Detection System (IDS), a system to detect if an unauthorized user has entered the computer network, was created and prototyped at the University of California.  </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <span>1992</span>-  "Message Digest 5"(MD5) becomes the first hashing algorithm to be developed and published to be used for companies to hash passwords for accounts on their internal networks as well as websites.  
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>1994</span>-  HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) was first created by Netscape Communications.  It works similar to normal HTTP, but the data that is transferred between the client and host, and vice versa, is encrypted.  
          </p>
          <span>1999</span>:  
          <ul>
            <li>The first Distributed Denial of Service(DDoS) attack occured at University of Minnesota. 
 </li>
            <li>The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program was created by the MITRE Corporation and is also sponsored by the Department of Homeland Security as well as the Cybersecurity and Information Security Agency.  The CVE program allows interested parties to learn more about known vulnerabilities by looking up a unique CVE-ID that is associated with each vulnerability.
 </li>
          </ul>
          <span>Early 2000's</span>:  
          <ul>
            <li>Many organizations started using the practice of implementing network Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) in their networks.  Unlike an IDS which only detects an intrusion, an IPS can automatically stop a network intrusion when it occurs.  </li>
            <li>The first firewall for personal computers of the average consumer was first sold.  It was named "ZoneAlarm".  </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <span>2010</span>-  STUXNET becomes the first computer worm that attacks Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems as well as Programable Logic Controllers (PLC).  These systems are used in utility industries to monitor and control equipment. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>2013</span>-  The NIST Cybersecurity Framework, which are standards of cybersecurity practices, was established to help organizations understand and implement cybersecurity controls to improve the organization's posture against cybersecurity risks.  
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>2017</span>-  The infamous WannaCry ransomeware attack occured.  It was infamously known for the speed as well as the targets that it attacked.
